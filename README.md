# Loan Application System

## Introduction
The **Loan Application System** is a web application that enables users to apply for loans, view the status of their applications, compare loan options, and manage repayment schedules. Admin users can view all applications, approve or reject them, and monitor loan statistics. This project is built using **vanilla HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript**, with Firebase handling authentication and database operations.

## Features
- Firebase Email/Password Authentication
- Role-based dashboard (User vs Admin)
- Multi-step Loan Application Form
- Loan Status Tracking for Users
- EMI Calculator & Loan Comparison Tool
- Repayment Calendar View (Paid, Due, Overdue)
- Admin Approval and Rejection Functionality

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
- Firebase used to manage authentication and Firestore database.
- `users` collection in Firestore stores user roles (`user` or `admin`).
- Loan application data stored in `loanApplications` collection.
- Role-based routing handled on the frontend using session/auth state.
- No framework used â€” plain JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for simplicity and performance.
